```

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation

### 1. Integration with Products Page

The advanced image uploader is integrated into the product creation form by replacing the old image upload section:

```php
<!-- Old implementation -->
<div class="border-2 border-dashed border-gray-300 rounded-lg p-6 text-center">
    <input type="file" name="images[]" multiple accept="image/*">
    <div id="imagePreview" class="mt-4 grid grid-cols-4 gap-2"></div>
</div>

<!-- New implementation -->
<?php include 'advanced_image_uploader.php'; ?>
```

### 2. JavaScript Class Structure

The uploader is built around the `AdvancedImageUploader` class:

```javascript
class AdvancedImageUploader {
    constructor() {
        this.images = [];           // Array of image objects
        this.primaryIndex = -1;     // Index of primary image
        this.secondaryIndex = -1;   // Index of secondary image
        this.additionalIndices = []; // Indices of additional images
    }
}
```

### 3. Image Object Structure

Each image is stored as an object with the following properties:

```javascript
{
    file: File,           // The actual file object
    id: number,          // Unique identifier
    url: string          // Object URL for preview
}
```

## üéØ Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **Upload Images**
   - Click the upload area or drag & drop images
   - Select multiple images at once or add more later
   - Images are automatically categorized as primary, secondary, or additional

2. **Reorder Primary & Secondary**
   - Drag the primary (yellow) or secondary (blue) images to swap positions
   - Use the "Swap Primary ‚Üî Secondary" button for manual swapping
   - Only the first two images can be reordered

3. **Manage Additional Images**
   - Additional images (gray) can be moved to primary or secondary positions
   - Use the action buttons that appear on hover
   - Additional images maintain their relative order

4. **Remove Images**
   - Click the trash icon on any image to remove it
   - System automatically reassigns primary/secondary if needed

### For Developers

1. **Include the Component**
   ```php
   <?php include 'admin/advanced_image_uploader.php'; ?>
   ```

2. **Access the Uploader Instance**
   ```javascript
   // The uploader is automatically initialized as 'imageUploader'
   const images = imageUploader.getImages();
   const orderedImages = imageUploader.getOrderedImages();
   ```

3. **Form Submission**
   - The uploader automatically creates hidden file inputs
   - Images are submitted in the correct order: Primary ‚Üí Secondary ‚Üí Additional
   - No changes needed to existing form processing logic

## üé® Visual Design

### Color Coding
- **Primary Image**: Yellow border and background (`#fef3c7`)
- **Secondary Image**: Blue border and background (`#dbeafe`)
- **Additional Images**: Gray border and background (`#f9fafb`)

### Interactive Elements
- **Hover Effects**: Images scale slightly and show action buttons
- **Drag Handles**: Primary and secondary images show drag handles (‚Üï)
- **Order Badges**: Each image shows its position number
- **Action Buttons**: Move, remove, and swap buttons with hover effects

## üîß Technical Details

### Event Handling
- **File Selection**: Handles both click-to-upload and drag & drop
- **Image Reordering**: Drag & drop between primary and secondary containers
- **Button Actions**: Manual reordering and image removal
- **Form Integration**: Automatic creation of hidden file inputs

### Memory Management
- **Object URLs**: Properly created and revoked to prevent memory leaks
- **Event Listeners**: Cleaned up when images are removed
- **DOM Elements**: Efficiently updated without unnecessary re-renders

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Full support for drag & drop and File API
- **Mobile Devices**: Touch-friendly interface with fallback to file input
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works even if JavaScript is disabled

## üß™ Testing

### Test Page
Use `test_advanced_image_uploader.php` to test all functionality:

1. **Upload multiple images**
2. **Test drag & drop reordering**
3. **Test manual button reordering**
4. **Test image removal**
5. **Test form submission**

### Console Logging
The uploader includes comprehensive console logging for debugging:

```javascript
console.log('Uploading image for content key:', contentKey);
console.log('Image upload response:', data);
console.log('Updated image src to:', '../' + data.file_path);
```

## üîÑ Migration from Old System

### What Changed
- **File Input**: Replaced simple file input with advanced component
- **Preview System**: Replaced basic grid preview with categorized sections
- **JavaScript**: Replaced `setupImagePreview` with `AdvancedImageUploader` class

### What Stayed the Same
- **Form Submission**: Images are still submitted as `images[]` array
- **Backend Processing**: No changes needed to server-side image processing
- **Database Storage**: Same structure for storing image paths and order

### Backward Compatibility
- The new uploader is fully backward compatible
- Existing product creation logic continues to work
- No database schema changes required

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Image Cropping**: Add image cropping functionality
2. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple images for bulk actions
3. **Image Optimization**: Automatic image compression and optimization
4. **Advanced Sorting**: Allow reordering of additional images
5. **Image Validation**: More sophisticated file validation and error handling

### Extensibility
The modular design makes it easy to add new features:
- New image types can be added by extending the `createImageHTML` method
- Additional actions can be added to the action buttons
- Custom validation can be implemented in the `handleFileSelection` method

## üìù Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Images not uploading**
   - Check file type restrictions (JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP)
   - Check file size limits (5MB max)
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled

2. **Drag & drop not working**
   - Ensure you're dragging primary or secondary images
   - Check browser compatibility
   - Try using the manual swap button instead

3. **Form submission issues**
   - Check that hidden inputs are being created
   - Verify the form has `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
   - Check browser console for errors

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by checking the browser console for detailed information about:
- File selection events
- Image upload responses
- Drag & drop operations
- Form submission data
